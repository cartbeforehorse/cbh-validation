CBH Validation Sys
==================
PHP is a soft-typed language (although it seems slowly to be getting harder-typed as it evolves).
This is great, at least up until the point that it isn't so great any more.  But in the real world
every seasoned developer eventually discovers the need to prevent certain variables from storing a
value that has no business being there at all.

This package simply creates a few checking functions to verify that variables actually hold the values
and datatypes that it was intended to.
